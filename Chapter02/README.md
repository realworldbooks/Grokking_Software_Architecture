## How to Run

* **JavaScript files (.js):** Run using Node.js (e.g., `node 2.3.2_maintainability/shoppingCart.js`).
* **Python files (.py):** Run using Python 3 (e.g., `python 2.7.1_weighted-decision-model/decision_model.py`).
* **Node.js Projects:** The `2.3.3_testability` and `2.4.1_constraints-in-action` examples are full Node.js projects. They require an `npm install` first. See their individual `README.md` files for full instructions.
