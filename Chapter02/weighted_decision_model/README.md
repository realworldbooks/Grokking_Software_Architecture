# Weighted Decision Model (Chapter 2.7.1)

This Python script is a simple, runnable example of the "Weighted Decision Model" discussed in Chapter 2. It's a tool to help turn a complex decision with multiple options and criteria into a simple, data-driven choice.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to this directory (`Chapter02/weighted decision model/`) in your terminal.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python decisionEngine.py
    ```
