# 2.4.1 Constraints in Action (CSV Export)

This runnable Node.js/Express server demonstrates the "Good Enough for Now" CSV export solution.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  From this directory (`/constraints-in-action/`), run `npm install` to install Express.
3.  Once installed, run `npm start` to start the server.

## How to Test

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000/export-user-data**

Your browser will automatically download a file named `user_data_123.csv` containing the hardcoded user data.
